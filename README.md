# Lighthouse Labs | TCP Breakout

Goal: Question App (server asks... client says yes or no)

## TCP is Transmission Control Protocol

* Relatively large header size
* Requires a formal, ongoing connection
* Corrupted packets are reported to the server, bad data can be re-sent
* Packets arrive in-order
* Useful for cases where guaranteed communication is key
